### Restaurant Billing Management System 

Coursework for a programming university module I have taken.

#### About

I built this restaurant billing management system as part of my Java coursework for my programming class. The application is built using JavaFX for the UI, OpenCSV to handle importing and exporting order data and Twilio to send order updates to users.

#### Instructions for use 

I recommend exporting the project to a runnable jar or running the `Main.java` file in an IDE of your choice.
